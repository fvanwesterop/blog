On this site Iâ€™ll be writing on my endavours of learning technologies and eco-systems such as:

- NodeJS ecosystem with Angular, Gulp and Bower
- Groovy ecosystem with Gradle, SDKman, Lazybones, Grails and Spock
- Docker ecosystem with tools like Compose and Swarm

This will result in a number of short how-to kinda articles. Enjoy reading!
