These are the sources of my blog site at GitHub. It is powered by these awesome technologies from the Groovy ECO-system:

* http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc]
* http://jbake.org/[JBake]
* https://gsp.grails.org/latest/guide/index.html[Groovy Server Pages]
* http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/[Bootstrap]
* https://gradle.org/[Gradle].

I write the actual blog posts and other content in AsciiDoc format. These documents are then transformed by JBake using GSP page templates and Bootstrap stylesheets into HTML format. These HTML files are then published on my https://fvanwesterop.github.io/blog/[GitHub Pages] website. All this is orchestrated a Gradle build.

The Gradle https://github.com/fvanwesterop/blog/blob/master/build.gradle[build file] is the center piece controlling the whole process. It delegates to some helper build-files to keep things nice and uncomplected, to use a nice word revived by https://github.com/tallesl/Rich-Hickey-fanclub[Rich Hickey] the other day. There are some neat Gradle plugins helping me out here:

* https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake-gradle-plugin[JBake plugin] - Does the actual conversion from AsciiDoc to HTML and works with Gradle's continuous build mode.
* https://github.com/aalmiray/livereload-gradle-plugin[LiveReload plugin] - Reloads the site-under-development continiously while authoring the AsciiDoc content.
* https://github.com/ajoberstar/gradle-git[Gadle-git plugin] - Publishes the HTML site to my Github Pages.

Feel free to re-use my setup to get your your site going if you'd like. After cloning the project simply type `./gradlew tasks` and read the information below the _Build Website tasks_ section. Then read the JBake documentation to customize stuff to your liking.

Ofcourse, you cannot use or re-publish my content files without my explicit permission: That's all copyrighted material and belongs to me. This applies to everything living below the `src`-folder. The rest is all copylefted and free to use for you.
